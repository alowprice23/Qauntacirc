# Plan for the `docs` Directory (v4 - Exhaustive & Comprehensive)

## 1. Guiding Philosophy & Core Principles

The `docs` directory is a critical component of the QuantaCirc system. It is not just supplementary material; it is an integral part of the project that serves to make the complex underlying principles accessible, the system usable, and the community contributions effective.

1.  **Audience-Centric**: The documentation will be meticulously structured to serve multiple distinct audiences:
    *   **Users/Operators**: Need clear "how-to" guides, deployment instructions, and troubleshooting information.
    *   **Developers/Contributors**: Need deep dives into the architecture, agent contracts, and contribution guidelines.
    *   **Researchers/Academics**: Need a rigorous explanation of the mathematical and theoretical foundations.
2.  **Living Documentation**: The documentation is code. It will be built, tested, and deployed with the same CI/CD pipeline as the application itself. We will use tools like `mkdocstrings` to generate API documentation directly from the source code, ensuring it never becomes stale.
3.  **Verifiability and Traceability**: Claims made in the documentation will be linked back to the specific proofs (`proofs/` directory) or empirical studies (`experiments/` directory) that substantiate them. This builds trust and reinforces the system's commitment to rigor.
4.  **Clarity and Accessibility**: The documentation will strive to explain complex topics—from category theory to quantum-inspired optimization—in clear, accessible language, supplemented with diagrams, examples, and visualizations.
5.  **Completeness**: The documentation will cover every aspect of the system, leaving no part unexplained.

## 2. File-by-File Implementation Plan

This plan details every file within the `docs` directory.

### **File: `docs/index.md`**
*   **Purpose**: The main landing page of the documentation website. It will provide a high-level overview of QuantaCirc, its philosophy, and a guide to the rest of the documentation.
*   **Est. LOC**: 200
*   **Implementation**: Will include a "What is QuantaCirc?" section, a "Who is this for?" section, and a table of contents.

### **File: `docs/getting-started.md`**
*   **Purpose**: The primary entry point for new users. A hands-on tutorial that gets a user from zero to a running "hello world" project.
*   **Est. LOC**: 400
*   **Implementation**: Will include sections on installation, setting up credentials, running `qc init`, generating a simple application with `qc generate`, and verifying the result with `qc verify`.

### Sub-directory: `docs/api/`
*   **Purpose**: Auto-generated API documentation.
*   **Key Files**: `core.md`, `agents.md`, `llm.md`, `cli.md`. Each file will be generated by `mkdocstrings` from the Python docstrings in the corresponding source code directories.

### Sub-directory: `docs/user-guide/`
*   **Purpose**: A comprehensive guide for users of the QuantaCirc system.
*   **Key Files**:
    *   **`basic-usage.md`**: Detailed explanations of the main CLI commands.
    *   **`advanced-features.md`**: Covers topics like custom agent configuration, multi-environment deployments, and using the `tools`.
    *   **`troubleshooting.md`**: A guide to diagnosing and solving common problems.

### Sub-directory: `docs/developer-guide/`
*   **Purpose**: A guide for those who want to contribute to QuantaCirc itself.
*   **Key Files**:
    *   **`architecture.md`**: A deep dive into the system's architecture, including diagrams.
    *   **`contributing.md`**: The full contributing guidelines.
    *   **`testing.md`**: A detailed explanation of the testing strategy.

### Sub-directory: `docs/mathematics/`
*   **Purpose**: The theoretical core of the documentation.
*   **Key Files**:
    *   **`quantum-mechanics.md`**: Explains the quantum formalism used in the system.
    *   **`statistical-mechanics.md`**: Explains the statistical concepts, including the two-phase annealing process.
    *   **`mathematical-closure.md`**: A detailed explanation of the `Δ` closure rule set.
    *   **`convergence-theory.md`**: A deep dive into the Lyapunov and Banach convergence proofs.

### Other Key Files and Directories
*   **`docs/agents/`**: A directory containing a detailed markdown file for each of the 10 agents.
*   **`docs/deployment/`**: Detailed guides for deploying on different platforms.
*   **`docs/assets/`**: Images, diagrams, and other static assets.
*   **`docs/_config.yml`**: The configuration file for the documentation site generator.

This exhaustive documentation plan ensures that the QuantaCirc system is not only powerful but also understandable, usable, and extensible.
